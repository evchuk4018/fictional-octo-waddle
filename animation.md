# Animation Opportunities

- Bottom nav: active tab indicator slide + icon pop on tap
- Dashboard: staggered reveal for KPI cards and goal summaries
- Goals list: reorder feedback (lift, shadow, slight scale), drop snap animation
- Task list: swipe-to-complete with spring + fade-out on complete
- Task creation: modal/inline form expand with height + opacity
- Progress bars: animate fill on load and when updated
- Circular progress: smooth tween to new value
- Empty states: subtle float or pulse to draw attention
- Page transitions: cross-fade between dashboard/goals with route change
- Login: input focus highlight and button press ripple
- Error states: shake animation on failed form submission
- Milestone celebration: confetti burst and goal card highlight on completion
- Hover states: subtle lift and shadow on interactive elements for desktop users
- Loading states: skeleton shimmer for goal/task lists while fetching data
- Drag-and-drop: lifted item follows cursor with shadow, drop target highlights, and items animate to new positions on reorder
- Responsive layout changes: animate between column and row layouts on breakpoint changes for smoother transitions
- Accessibility: ensure all animations respect reduced motion preferences and provide non-animated alternatives where necessary.
- Performance: prioritize lightweight animations that enhance UX without causing jank, especially on mobile devices.
- Consistency: maintain a cohesive animation style across the app to reinforce brand identity and improve user familiarity.
